A company sells a SaaS (Software as a service) to business clients that chose to subscribe to one of the three subscription levels, Starter, Premium or Elite, which provide different features at different price points (more storage and other capabilities). Starter has the least functionality, while Elite includes the most features.\nNow imagine, you are working as an analyst for that company and are asked to examine the relationship between follow-up calls to the clients and their satisfaction with the product and service. Follow-up calls are voluntary and are just to help the client with possible problems and so on. Satisfaction is measured on a weekly basis by surveying the clients.\nIn the data, you find three variables: satisfaction, follow_ups and subscription. Perform the following steps:\n\n#Load the customer satisfaction data\ncustomer_data &lt;- readRDS('C:/Users/user/Documents/TUHH/Causal/Causal_Data_Science_Data/customer_sat.rds')\ncustomer_data\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n# Explore the data\nhead(customer_data)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n# Fit a regression model: satisfaction ~ follow-ups\n\n## Simple linear Regression ##\nmodel_unadjusted &lt;- lm(satisfaction ~ follow_ups, data = customer_data)\n\nsummary(model_unadjusted)\n\n#&gt; \n#&gt; Call:\n#&gt; lm(formula = satisfaction ~ follow_ups, data = customer_data)\n#&gt; \n#&gt; Residuals:\n#&gt;     Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n#&gt; -12.412  -5.257   1.733   4.506  12.588 \n#&gt; \n#&gt; Coefficients:\n#&gt;             Estimate Std.

Incorporating subscription information altered the direction of the association between Follow-ups and satisfaction, shifting it from negative to positive.
